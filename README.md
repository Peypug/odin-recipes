# odin-recipes
First project in The Odin Project introduction. 
This project will test my HTML skills when I create a recipe website. 
Once I have completed this project I will have demonstrated my ability to structure a HTML program correctly, to use elements like <p> and <h1>, and to create lists, links, and images.
